# Kick
Kicks a member from the server

```
r!kick @Shingo#8438

r!kick @Shingo#8438 Alt accounts are not allowed
```

## Kick by id
On larger servers, offline users or recently come online users, may not be detected by Reimu with the above version of the command.
If the kick did not work, replacing the ping with the user's ID will cause Reimu to re-download the guild's user listing and find the user.
